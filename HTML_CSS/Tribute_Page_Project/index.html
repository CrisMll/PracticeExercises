            <h2>Who Was Hedy Lamarr?</h2>
            <p>Hedy Lamarr was an actress during the "Golden Age" of MGM. She starred in films such as Tortilla Flat, Lady of the Tropics,
            with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracey. <p>Lamarr was also a scientist, inventing an early technique for spread spectrum communications - the key to
            spectrum communications - the key to many of today's wireless communications. 
            In 1942, at the height of her career, Lamarr gained recognition in a field very different from entertainment.
            She and her friend, the composer George Antheil, patented an idea for a radio signalling device, or "secret communications system". 
            which was a means of changing radio frequencies to prevent enemies from decoding messages. Originally developed to defeat the German Nazis
            the system became an important step in the development of technology to ensure the security of both military communications and mobile phones.</p>
            <p>Lamarr wasn't immediately recognised for her communications invention, as its far-reaching implications were not understood until decades later.
            A recluse in later life, Lamarr died in 2000 at her home in Florida. 
            Despite her death in 2000, Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014 for the development of her frequency hopping technology. 
            This achievement has led Lamarr to be called "the mother of Wi-Fi" and other wireless communications such as GPS and Bluetooth.

            <h2>Here's a time line of Hedy Lamarr life:</h2>
            <ul class="time-list">
                <li data-year="1914"> - Born in Viena, Austria</li>
                <li data-year="1930"> - as a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting, but her brilliant mind was ignored
                and her beauty took center stage when she was discovered by the director Max Reinhard at age 16.</li>
                <li data-year="1932"> - Lamarr gained name recognition as an actress for her role in the controversial film, Ecstasy.</li>
                <li data-year="1933"> - She was married, but it was an unhappy marriage</li>
                <li data-year="1937"> - She escaped from her husband's grasp by fleeing to London</li>
                <li data-year="1940"> - She met George Antheil, composer and pianist. Discussing with him, the idea was raised that a
                frequency-hopping signal might prevent the torpedo's radio guidance system from being tracked or jammed. 
                Antheil succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player piano mechanism with radio signals. 
                Antheil sketched out the idea for the frequency-hopping system, which was to use a perforated paper tape
                which actuated pneumatic controls (as was already used in player pianos).  </li>
                <li data-year="1942"> - She patented her work. Neither the US Navy nor that of any other nation were using
                radio-controlled torpedoes at the time, and electro-mechanical devices
                were soon to be made obsolete by purely electronic controls.</li>
                <li data-year="1997"> - Lamarr and Antheil received the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award and the
                Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements
                in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society.</li>
                <li data-year="2000"> - Dies at the age of 85</li>
                <li data-year="2014"> - Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame</li>
            </ul>
