## Survey Form

<p>This is the final test of the initial module of the Responsive Web Design Certification course.
I have to create a survey form with at least four fieldsets that use differents input elements and have an ID for each other.<br/>
All other content, styling and the structure of the html file is completely free and has been done by me with no other rules.</p>
